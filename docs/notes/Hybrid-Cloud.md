**On-premise data centers** have been around for a long time, providing businesses with the ability to manage and control their own IT infrastructure. However, these centers can be quite expensive to maintain, which is why many organizations are increasingly opting to move to the **cloud**.

The **public cloud** offers the same, and often more, features as traditional on-premise data centers, but at a lower cost and with greater flexibility. In recent years, there has been a shift in software development from building large, monolithic applications to creating smaller, more manageable applications known as **microservices**. Microservices make it easier to write, update, and deploy code. Each microservice operates within its own container, often managed by services like **Kubernetes** (K8s).

While this approach has many benefits, such as scalability and ease of management, there are still challenges when it comes to security, speed, and compliance. This is where the concept of a **hybrid cloud** comes in. A hybrid cloud environment combines on-premise infrastructure with cloud resources, allowing organizations to take advantage of both.

However, hybrid cloud setups come with their own set of disadvantages:

1. **Cost**: Managing both on-premise and cloud environments can be more expensive.
2. **Learning Curve**: Engineers familiar with on-premise systems need to learn about cloud technologies.
3. **Feature Discrepancy**: Certain features available in the cloud might not be available on-premise, and vice versa.

To address these challenges, Dell and VMware have collaborated to create servers with cloud-like features built in. **VMware Cloud Foundation** is integrated into Dell servers, enabling organizations to perform both on-premise and cloud operations seamlessly. This same cloud foundation is also integrated into various cloud services, simplifying management and operations across environments.

**Software-Defined Data Centers (SDDC)** further enhance this by allowing automation of various tasks. SDDCs bring cloud-like features to on-premise servers, making it easier to manage resources and create containers using Kubernetes.
